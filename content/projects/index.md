### Fairness and Algorithmic Bias in Artificial Intelligence

The ubiquity of deep learning in our daily lives has demonstrated the need for [fair AI][fairai].
This research effort attempts to design and engineer models and algorithms for fair Artificial
Intelligence.

- Project Lead: [David Oniani][david]

### AI-driven Precision Rehabilitation

The AI-driven Precision Rehabilitation models will be able to recommend rehabilitation strategies
with the best clinical outcomes for individual patients, including specific types of exercises,
number of sessions, types of manual therapies, and therapeutic modalities, etc.

- Project Lead: Stephen Shaffran

### Zero-shot Learning for Clinical Natural Language Processing

The lack of gold standard datasets is the biggest bottleneck for Clinical Natural Language
Processing (NLP). This project will apply zero-shot learning (ZSL) approaches to Clinical NLP and
develop novel ZSL methods tailored to Clinical NLP.

- Project Lead: [Sonish Sivarajkumar][sonish]

### Next-generation Clinical Information Retrieval Framework

This project aims to develop next-generation information retrieval (IR) framework to facilitate
clinical and translational research.

- Project Lead: [Sonish Sivarajkumar][sonish]

---

### Few-shot Learning for Clinical Natural Language Processing

This project aims to develop novel few-shot learning (FSL) approaches for Clinical NLP.

- Project Lead: [David Oniani][david]

---

### Natural Language Processing for Health Literacy

This project aims to leverage NLP and AI techniques to tackle the health literacy problem faced by
both patients and clinicians.

- Project Lead: [David Oniani][david], Sreekanth Sreekumar

### Extraction of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) from Clinical Notes

This project examines the documentation and extraction of SDOH in clinical notes for a variety of
diseases.

- Project Lead: Haneef Ahmed Mohammad
