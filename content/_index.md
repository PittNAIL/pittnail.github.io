Welcome to PittNAIL, the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt]'s Clinical **N**atural Language Processing
and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence Innovation **L**aboratory. PittNAIL is led by [Dr. Yanshan
Wang][drwang]. PittNAIL's Associate Director is [David Oniani][david].

<!-- Intro {{{ -->

PittNAIL's research focus centers on clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies and applications in
healthcare. Our research goal is to leverage different dimensions of data (electronic health
records, biomedical literature, health education materials, etc) and data-driven computational
approaches (NLP/AI/ML/DL) to meet the needs of clinicians, researchers, patients, and customers.

### News

- Dec, 2023. The GREAT PLEA ethical principles have been reported in several media coverages: [news-medical][great1], [AI in Healthcare][great2].
- Dec, 2023. Our paper "Adopting and expanding ethical principles for generative artificial intelligence from military to healthcare" is published in the Nature npj Digital Medicine. In this paper, we propose the “GREAT PLEA” ethical principles, namely Governability, Reliability, Equity, Accountability, Traceability, Privacy, Lawfulness, Empathy, and Autonomy, for generative AI applications in healthcare.
