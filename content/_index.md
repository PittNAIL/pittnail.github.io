<!-- Intro {{{ -->

Yanshan Wang, PhD, FAMIA is Assistant Professor and Vice Chair of Research within the Department of
Health Information Management, University of Pittsburgh. His research interests focus on artificial
intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning
methodologies and applications in healthcare. His research goal is to leverage different dimensions
of data and data-driven computational approaches to meet the needs of clinicians, researchers,
patients, and customers. Prior to joining Pitt, Dr. Wang was Assistant Professor in the Department
of AI & Informatics at Mayo Clinic.
