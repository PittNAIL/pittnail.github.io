Welcome to PittNAIL, the [University of Pittsburgh][pitt]'s Clinical **N**atural Language Processing and **A**rtificial
**I**ntelligence Innovation **L**aboratory. PittNAIL is led by [Dr. Yanshan Wang][drwang].

<!-- Intro {{{ -->

PittNAIL's research focus centers on clinical natural language processing (NLP), artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) methodologies and applications in
healthcare. Our research goal is to leverage different dimensions of data (electronic health
records, biomedical literature, health education materials, etc) and data-driven computational
approaches (NLP/AI/ML/DL) to meet the needs of clinicians, researchers, patients, and customers.
